# REACTJS CHALLENGE

This is a clone of dev.to, made it with ReactJs and Tailwind.
This dev.to is using an API that we already developed.


# Steps to use the web page on the localhost

1. We have to point to the directory where we want to clone our git repository

2. Then we use the command line 

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ivzc07/devto-nextjs-clone.git
```

3. Once we have our repository cloned we point again to our directory
```
cd ./desafio-backend.git
```
4. We must install all our project's dependecies with the next command, so we can use our project properly

```
$ npm i

```

7. If we already have all our stuff arranged now we are available to run our project, and we will do that using our command 
```
npm run dev
```
This command in particularly runs a script that recides in our package.json so the whole script would be:

```
npm next dev
```
From now we have our web page running in http//:localhost:3000
